# Canvas 2 Org

Scrapes an assignments page on ELMS Canvas and converts it to an org-mode file, complete with deadlines and categorization. This
was my first time using Selenium, so this project is far from elegant. Consider it a hacky soltion that seems to work.

Note that ELMS Canvas does have an API, but accessing this requires an authtoken that the university needs to provide.
